# Web-accessibility
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1 billion people suffer from either
disabling hearing loss, or vision impairment or blindness. To avoid unintentionally excluding anyone
from accessing your website, it is important to make web accessibility a priority, and accept it as a
core part of your projects, rather than an afterthought.

From a broad perspective, an accessible website is one that is readily available and
comprehensible to any user regardless of their device, situation, or ability.

The question that you need to answer, then, is this:
How can I design and develop an accessible webpage from scratch?

The webpage is to contain a tutorial with images explaining the different steps. What the tutorial is
about, is up to you. It could be a tutorial on how to create an accessible webpage or -site, one on
how to make the perfect cupcake or something completely different."
